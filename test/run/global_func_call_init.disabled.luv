// Can't emit this naively as C because the call to stuff won't be constant.
// Could:
// - evaluate in compiler, sort of like running stuff() as a macro
// - disallow this, just like C does
// - inject the call to stuff at the top of main() or otherwise do something
// similarly C++y, but then there's order sorting complexity, etc.
